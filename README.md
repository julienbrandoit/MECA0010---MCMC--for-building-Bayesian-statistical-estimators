# Uncertainty Quantification and Seismic Source Estimation

This repository contains the report and code for estimating seismic event epicenters using Bayesian inference and MCMC methods. 
The project addresses a probabilistic inverse problem, estimating the coordinates of a seismic source based on noisy arrival times recorded at multiple stations.

Key components include:

- Bayesian Estimation: Incorporates measurement uncertainty to model epicentral coordinates.
- MCMC Sampling: Uses the Random-Walk Metropolis-Hastings (RWMH) algorithm to explore the posterior distribution.
- Uncertainty Quantification: Provides Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimates and constructs credible regions to assess the uncertainty around epicenter predictions.

I provide the academic report, the original assignment and the python code to generate the results and the figures.
